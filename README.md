## INSURANCE COST PREDICTION

#### ABSTRACT 
Insurance is a policy that eliminates or decreases loss costs occurred by various
risks. Various factors influence the cost of insurance. These considerations
contribute to the insurance policy formulation. Machine Learning (ML) for the
insurance industry sector can make the wording of insurance policies more
efficient.

#### DATASET 
The data set includes seven attributes, the data set is separated into two-part the
first part called training data, and the second called test data; training data makes
up about 80 percent of the total data used, and the rest for test data. The training
data set is applied to build a model as a predictor of medical insurance cost year
and the test set will use to evaluate the regression model. 

#### SOFTWARES USED
  ###### Sklearn
  ###### Matplotlib
  ###### Pandas
  ###### Numpy
  ###### Seaborn

#### CONCLUSION

For this dataset the computations that were taken place without PCA seemed
promising as they had straight fit model outputs when a scatter plot was drawn
between y train and y train predict.
 -  We could observe that the performance of the model was optimum when the data set was performed by following the method without PCA for both RFR and MLR.
 - From the graphs plotted we can also conclude that RFR model has optimum fit for the data set when compared to MLR model.
 - The RFR with PCA model seemed too overfit for the given data set hence the problem can be solved by either adding more data or by choosing a best model for the existing data.
